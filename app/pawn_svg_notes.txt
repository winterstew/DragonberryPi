I used inkscape to draw the pawns.svg; then I cut it apart for use in various
ways.  Depending on how I did it and how I used it in adventure.php changed how
each browser treated it. 

When I added the display="none" to control visibility of the maps (which
prevented hidden maps from offsetting visible ones), it broke my pawn display.
Anything in the <defs> dsection was lost.  It appears that the svg use the defs
from the first time they apear in the html.  So when they are not displayed
they are treated as is they do not exist.  I made a zero size svg right at the
begining of the <body> which contained only the <def>.  This allowed the
various gradients to be defined globaly, and prevents them from offsetting any
elements in a display divition.

Clippath definitions could not be references globally in Chrome however.  So I
put the clipath definition in each pawn.

The pattern definition for the "petrified" indicator could not be references
neither globally nor individually.  The stone always appears grey with no
bitmap
